      <h2>How does Cryptos work?</h2>

      <p>Cryptos is a JavaScript-based iOS application, written with React Native. Add something here. In the background, an Express server rapidly queries foreign APIs (like Bittrex, Coin Market Cap, and Coin Base), collects current and historical data, and serves it up to the app. </p>

      <p>You can find the source code for the <a href="#">React Native application</a> and the <a href="#">back end API</a> on Github.</p>
